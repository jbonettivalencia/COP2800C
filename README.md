## Description
This Java application creates a table of sales and commissions using the following rules:

- Sales between $10,001 and $15,000 get 12% commission.
- Sales over $15,000 receive a 15% commission.

It calculates the commission using a 'while' loop and 'if else' commands before printing the results in a structured table.

Sales   Commission  
$5,000  $500.00  
$6,000  $600.00  
...  
$20,000 $3,000.00
